## Documentation

### Add layers
- **You need to replace the existing layers by your layers**
- **Do not delete the `LAYERS` and `BASE_LAYER` folders, but replace the images in them**
- **The images used must be PNG files**
- **The name of each layer (PNG file) will be the name used for the metadata**
    - For example, if the name of a layer into a subdirectory is red.png, the name used will be "red"
- **To add layers, you need to add them into the `LAYERS` directory**
    - Place the background layers into the `BASE_LAYER` directory
    - Place the other layers with theirs respective directories (subdirectories) into the `LAYERS` directory
    - The name of the subdirectories for each category of layer will be the name used for the metadata
    - For example, the subdirectory "cercle" will be used to describe the layers that are into this directory

### Add Constrains
- **To add or modify constrains, you need to edit the `CONST.txt` file**
    - An example of a constrain:
        - The cercle 1.png cannot be with the square 1.png
        - cercle 1.png, square 1.png
    - Each part of the constrain is separated by a comma (,)
    - 1 constrain max per line
    - Each constrain contains 4 items:
        - Subdirectory 1
        - File name with extension
        - Subdirectory 2
        - File name with extension

### Edit `rarity.json`
- **The `rarity.json` file will be created the first time you will run the program**
- **To modify the rarity for each layer, you need to edit the `rarity.json` file**
- **The pourcentage is represented by decimal numbers**
    - 0.1 is the same as 10%
- **The summation for each layer category shall be equal to 1 or 100%**
- **You need to use the argument -f each time you made changes in the `LAYERS` directory**
- **You can recreate the `rarity.json` file with the -f argument**
    - ```shell
        python nft_art_creator.py 10000 -f
      ```

### Edit `metadata_template.json`
- **The `metadata_template.json` can be edited to your needs**
- **Note that you can only remove metadata and attributes for now**
- **You must not change or edit the field, when the value is `TBD - Will be generated by the software!`**
- **You might edit the `name`, `description`, `Generation` and `Level`**

### Upload to IPFS
- **You can use the built-in IPFS uploader or you can manually upload your `collection directory` and your `metadata directory` to an IPFS pinning service**
- **Be aware that the built-in IPFS uploader doesn't pin the data**
- **It is strongly recommended to pin your data since your data can be added to the garbage collection**
- **For the ultimate safety, it is recommended to run your own IPFS nodes**
- **To view your IPFS data, you can use an IPFS explorer:**
